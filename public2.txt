Had a great day with my friends at the park today!

Sour patch kids are awesome

Fun fact: the oscars can be as early as mid February, to as late as the end of march, and are usually planned around Meryl Streep's schedule

Got a new phone so text me so I have your number

Thank you for everything you have done for me and all the drama students. Proud to call you a mentor and great friend

I have been putting a perfume on my list for the past 3 years and my mom got so tired of seeing it on there that she bought it #success

It looks so beautiful love

Don't wanna talk about how many deviled eggs I had today

One thing I have learned over this past year is to always do whatever it takes to be happy and spread that happiness as much as you can.

Happy birthday!!

If I got a handwritten letter in the mail I would be so happy, I wish people still did that

All my freckles have come out of hibernation

My little sister is 3 years younger than me yet such an inspiration to me everyday.

Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, because your character is what you really are, while your reputations is merely what others think you are.

The most beautiful thin you can wear is confidence
